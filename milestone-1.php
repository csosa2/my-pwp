			<h2>Purpose:</h2>
			<p>The purpose of this website is to showcase my skillset, past work and personality to future employers,
				potential clients and fellow colleagues in the tech industry. This website will be used as a portfolio
				and resume to show my skills.</p>
			<h2>Audience:</h2>
			<p>The audience will include professional colleagues, potential employers and possible clients.</p>
			<h2>Goal:</h2>
			<p>The goal is to acquire a full time employment with a local company, work as a freelancer with small
				business clientele and work with fellow developers on different endeavours.</p>
			<h2>Persona:</h2>
			<h3>Name:</h3>
			<p>Jane Smith</p>
			<h3>Age:</h3>
			<p>35</p>
			<h3>Role:</h3>
			<p>Manager at RiskSense in Albuquerque, NM</p>

			<p>Jane is very comfortable with technology and describes her computer skills as advanced. For work, she has
				a Lenovo ThinkPad P40 Yoga laptop that docks into her dual screen station at the office. When not on her
				laptop, Jane uses her Nexus 6P to check emails on the go. Jane loves using Google products and uses them to
				communicate and work during team projects.</p>
			<h3>Behaviors and Attitudes:</h3>

				on projects. Jane's best attribute, she always keeps calm under stress. </p>
			<h3>Scenario:</h3>
			<p>Jane has been a manager with RiskSense for five years. She has worked for a few tech companies in
				Albuquerque before finding her current position at RiskSense. Jane realizes that her front end
				development team is getting a little overwhelmed with work and asks if the company can hire another
				full-time developer to help alleviate the stress of a growing company. After approval and posting, Jane will
				be involved in the interview process to help search for the perfect addition to her front end development
				team.</p>
			<h3>Goal:</h3>
			<p> Jane is determined to find the best person to join her front end development team. With limited time on
				her hands, she hopes to find some potential candidates through social media, community meet-ups and
				looking through professional websites.
			</p>
			<h1>Use Case:</h1>
			<h2>Goal:</h2>
			<p>Jane wants to find a junior developer with advanced front end skills that show in his/her professoinal
