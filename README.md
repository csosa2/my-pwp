## PWP Milestone 1 Feedback
Excellent work on Milestone 1! Your purpose, audience, goal, persona, and use case are all very clear and descriptive. Your HTML is formatted very well and adheres to our style guide.

Your Milestone 1 Passes at [Tier IV](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric). Information regarding milestone 2 can be found in the [Milestone 2 Documentation](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/milestone-two).

### Edits &amp; Suggestions

- The only thing I noticed was that you have an extraneous `<footer>` tag sitting at the bottom of your document that you can safely delete if you're not going to use it.

## PWP Milestone 2&alpha; Feedback
Excellent job on the wireframes! I think a one page layout is a very appropriate choice for PWP. For a one-page layout, definitely keep your content on the shorter/lighter side, and keep the design choices clean and minimal. One page layouts have a tendency to become overwhelmed with too much information fast - and the best one-page designs veer towards minimalism and a sophisticated use of empty space. I think that this is very do-able based on what you have in your content strategy, but if you find that your About Me section grows beyond 2 about paragraphs or so, or you have perhaps more than 6 items in your Portfolio, perhaps consider creating separate pages.

**Home Page**: If you plan to feature a top nav on your full-screen layout, I'm not sure that additional calls to action below that direct users to the other regions of your page would be necessary. A call to action to scroll down **may** be useful on the mobile layout since the navigation will be hidden in the "drawer". Be cautious about featuring too many calls to action in your UI design as it can be visually overwhelming to the user. I like the idea of a drawer menu on mobile and a fixed header on full screens. Bear in mind that this will require some customization of the Bootstrap navbar. (We'll cover [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) soon!)

**About Me**: Keep this content on the brief side as mentioned above.

**Portfolio**: There is a great, very easy to implement jQuery gallery called [Swipebox](http://brutaldesign.github.io/swipebox/) that past students have had success with. The documentation is a little light, but it is fairly easy to use.

**Footer**: [FontAwesome](http://fontawesome.io/) will have your social media icons covered!

You're way ahead of the curve here, and you can use the extra time between front-end lectures to refine your design choices and create your content so you're not losing any time as we still have yet to cover CSS and [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/). Nice HTML - it's perfect. Your Milestone 1 passes at [Tier IV](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/). Nice work!
