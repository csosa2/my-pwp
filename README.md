## PWP Milestone 1 Feedback
Excellent work on Milestone 1! Your purpose, audience, goal, persona, and use case are all very clear and descriptive. Your HTML is formatted very well and adheres to our style guide.

Your Milestone 1 Passes at [Tier IV](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric). Information regarding milestone 2 can be found in the [Milestone 2 Documentation](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/milestone-two).

### Edits &amp; Suggestions

- The only thing I noticed was that you have an extraneous `<footer>` tag sitting at the bottom of your document that you can safely delete if you're not going to use it.
